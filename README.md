## About

SplitPro aims to provide an open-source way to share expenses with your friends.

It's meant to be a complete replacement for Splitwise.

It currently has most of the important features.

- Add expenses with an individual or groups
- Overall balances across the groups
- Multiple currency support
- Upload expense bills
- PWA support
- Split expense unequally (share, percentage, exact amounts, adjustments)
- Push notification
- Download your data
- Import from splitwise

**More features coming every day**

## Why

Splitwise is one of the best apps to add expenses and bills.

I understand that every app needs to make money, After all, lots of effort has been put into Splitwise. My main problem is how they implemented this.

Monetising on pro features or ads is fine, but asking money for adding expenses (core feature) is frustrating.

I was searching for other open-source alternatives (Let's be honest, any closed-source product might do the same and I don't have any reason to believe otherwise).

I managed to find a good app [spliit.app](https://spliit.app/) by [Sebastien Castiel](https://scastiel.dev/) but it's not a complete replacement and didn't suit my workflow sadly. Check it out to see if it fits you.

_That's when I decided to work on this_
