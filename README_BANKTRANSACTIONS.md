## Bank Account Connection

> GoCardless is deprecated. Please use Plaid instead.

### To get started with Plaid:

1. Create an account on Plaid.
2. Obtain your API keys (client_id and secret).
3. Add the API keys as environment variables in the split-pro repo. See the example in .env.example.
4. You’re done! ✅

### How to use the bank connection:

1. Connect your bank provider to your split-pro account. Log in to split-pro, go to your account page. If Plaid is set up correctly according to the steps above, you will see a “Connect to bank” option on the account page.
2. Once the connection is complete, you can start adding bank transactions. Go to Add new expense in either a group or friend page. There you will find “Transactions”. Click it, select the transactions you want to add, and then click “Submit all.”
