# Docker Setup for Splitpro

The following guide will walk you through setting up Splitpro using Docker. You can choose between a production setup using Docker Compose or a standalone container.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose (if using the Docker Compose setup)

## Option 1: Production Docker Compose Setup

This setup includes PostgreSQL and the Splitpro application.

1. Download the Docker Compose file from the Splitpro repository: [compose.yml](https://github.com/oss-apps/split-pro/blob/main/docker/prod/compose.yml)
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `compose.yml` file.
3. Create a `.env` file in the same directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example`
4. Adjust the variables to your deployment
5. Run the following command to start the containers:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the PostgreSQL database and the Splitpro application containers.

6. Access the Splitpro application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Option 2: Standalone Docker Container

If you prefer to host the Splitpro application on your container provider of choice, you can use the pre-built Docker image from DockerHub or GitHub's Package Registry.

1. Pull the Splitpro Docker image:

```
docker pull ossapps/splitpro
```

Or, if using GitHub's Package Registry:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/oss-apps/splitpro
```

2. Run the Docker container, providing the necessary environment variables for your database and SMTP host:

```
docker run -d \
  -p ${PORT:-3000}:${PORT:-3000} \
  -e PORT=${PORT:-3000} \
  -e DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL:?err} \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL=${NEXTAUTH_URL:?err} \
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=${NEXTAUTH_SECRET:?err} \
  -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=${GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID:?err} \
  -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=${GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET:?err}
  ossapps/splitpro
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual database and aws details.

1. Access the Splitpro application by visiting the URL you provided in the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable in your web browser.

## Success

You have now successfully set up Splitpro using Docker. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please seek assistance from the community.

## Migrating instance

To migrate your instance it is sufficient to copy the `.env` file as well as to migrate your database.

#### DB backup

```bash
docker exec -t <postgres container name> pg_dumpall -c -U postgres > splitpro_backup.sql
```

#### DB restore

```bash
cat splitpro_backup.sql | docker exec -i <postgres container name> psql -U postgres
```

## Authentication

We use NextAuth for authentication providers, offering email, Google and Authentik providers out of the box. Other providers can be customized as OIDC providers, but remember that an OIDC callback is needed. Set up yout `NEXTAUTH_URL` and then a callback address of `https://${NEXTAUTH_URL}/api/auth/callback/oidc`.
